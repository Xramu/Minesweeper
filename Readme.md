# Minesweeper Practice Project With Unity 2023.2.18f1
I was interested in learning the new UIToolkit Unity has introduced, so I decided to quickly make an UI based Minesweeper game.

Keeping the code here for anyone who is interested to take a peek.

### [C# scripts can be found in Assets/Scripts](Assets/Scripts)

No build of the game is available since it is quite unneccessary. Minesweeper can be found and played in an internet browser.

## Features
- Creating a custom game with chosen grid size and mine amount
- Clicking on a revealed field to clear all of its neighbours if there are enough flags around
- Automatically revealing big empty field clusters when one of the fields is revealed
- Chocolate chip cookies? Maybe?

## The Missing Ones
- Button, text field and mine graphics (Mines are marked with a simple X)
- Having a guaranteed safe click on the game starting click
